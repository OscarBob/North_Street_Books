What a wonderful evening we had at our January book club! Twenty avid readers gathered to discuss "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern.

The conversation ranged from the book's magical realism to its themes of choice and destiny. Special thanks to everyone who brought homemade treats—the lemon drizzle cake was exceptional!

**Next Month:** We'll be reading "Piranesi" by Susanna Clarke. Join us on February 20th at 7 PM. New members always welcome!
